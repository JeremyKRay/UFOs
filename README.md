# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist data journalist, Dana, with modifying a website she has created for an article she has been working on pertaining to UFO sightings. She is from McMinnville, Oregon, which is famous for UFO sightings and this is a topic that interests her. Dana has acquired data stored in a JavaScript array and she would like to incorporate this information into her website. To do this, a table is built from the data in the array and displayed on the website. In addition, using JavaScript, the table is filtered on 5 criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. The webpage is customized using Bootstrap so that these filters can be applied based on user input. Dana's original webpage's HTML file is modified so that her webpage reflects these changes.
